## Module 3 Challenge

### <p style="color:#CC6600">Part 1  |  PyBank</p> 

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".  
<br>
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
<br>  

The final script should also both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
